# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It focuses on understanding how the shell works, specifically in areas related to:

- Shell initialization files
- Shell variables (local and global)
- Environment variables
- Variable expansion
- Command substitution
- Arithmetic and logical expressions
- Aliases
- The PATH variable

## Files

Each script is named according to its task number:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-alias` | Creates an alias named `ls` that removes files (`rm *`) |
| `1-hello_you` | Prints `hello user`, where `user` is the current Linux user |
| `2-path` | Adds `/action` to the end of the `PATH` environment variable |
| `3-paths` | Counts the number of directories in the `PATH` variable |
| `4-global_variables` | Lists environment variables |
| `5-local_variables` | Lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions |
| `6-create_local_variable` | Creates a local variable `BEST=School` |
| `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a global variable `BEST=School` |
| `8-true_knowledge` | Adds 128 to the value of `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` and prints the result |
| `9-divide_and_rule` | Divides the value of `POWER` by `DIVIDE` |
| `10-love_exponent_breath` | Prints `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE` |
| `11-binary_to_decimal` | Converts binary value stored in `BINARY` to decimal |
| `12-combinations` | Prints all combinations of two letters except `oo` |
| `13-print_float` | Prints a number with two decimal places stored in `NUM` |
| `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal` | Converts number in `DECIMAL` to hexadecimal |
| `15-rot13` | Encodes and decodes input using `rot13` |
| `16-odd` | Prints every other line from input, starting with the first |
| `17-add_numbers` | Adds `WATER` and `STIR` environment variable values |

## Usage

```bash
./<script_name>
